            Benefits of Automated Online Student Attendance Tracker
            By the EZCheck.me team
            Jan 12 2021
            
            In the 21st Century, the education sector globally has undergone several critical milestones in realizing future sustainable development goals to include integrated information management systems in schools. These are the fundamental reasons why automated student tracking is not a huge surprise. The electronic student attendance management system is on course to give data control by doing away with manual processes and paperwork that would be time-consuming and cumbersome. Teachers have the liberty to monitor how students utilize their time in the classroom quickly. This brainchild has emanated sequentially from the urge to solve the loss of information that results from handling many students in schools manually. Most schools have incepted the online student tracking model, especially as a precursor to efficiency and effectiveness in evaluating students’ performance concerning their classroom attendances. The following is a discursive approach to the benefits of this data management system.
            
            
            Time-Saving
            Teachers utilizing the automated online student tracking systems no longer worry over time as this is a fluid flowing mechanism that does away with manual paperwork and closely following students. The interface presents a quick menu in elaborate apps where teachers can easily scrutinize the overall hours students have attended different courses. In the conventional system, teachers have to peruse massive amounts of paperwork to arrive at data relating to a particular student.
            
            
            Data Protection and Accuracy
            In this system, teachers eliminate the avenues of error because the attendance tracking apps have intricate features like voice recognition and real-time location data conveyance, which indicate a student identity. As such, students can no longer mark attendance for their missing classmates. No fuss or muss, and leeway for wrong information submission is entirely avoided. The data protection feature establishes fluent identity authentication, and students can submit their attendance over their smartphones.
            
            
            Productivity and Efficiency
            Most online student attendance tracking apps have efficient system architecture with several intertwined components. Smartphone apps are used for both students marking attendance and teachers conducting the process. Distributed servers are used to collect, store, and analyze attendance records submitted from students ’smartphones. In the electronic attendance data management app, there’s a precise real-time status tracking of leave requests.
            
            
            Cost Saving Economics
            For teachers specifically, the student attendance tracker regulates payment in relation to the amount of work done. Therefore, teachers can only be paid for the hours they’ve taught. Students can only be awarded for the hours they’ve attended classes. Online attendance management systems have solved issues relating to teachers’ reporting, absenteeism, time abuse, tardiness, and overpayment.
            
            
            Effective Management of Workflow
            For teachers in the private sector, an integrated attendance management app is such a heaven sent. It provides excellent visibility of all data easing the payroll workflow, performance review and leave management for schools. Most attendance management solutions are built up with integrated notification and alert permissions, enabling schools to approve a request for leave and early departure by teachers. These apps have eliminated the herculean task of manual scheduling. Within seconds, these systems help manage work allocation, schedules, and keep track of shift swaps for teachers. It enables users to forecast workloads, resources, and budgets.
            
            
            Flexibility
            Amid the hard-hitting COVID-19 pandemic blow, there is no better time to automate online student attendance tracking solutions that have been so quintessential and outstanding in data management. In schools across the globe, students and teachers would never have physically interacted, throwing the future of education at the verge of compromise. With these attendance management apps, it became easier for teachers, students, and schools to centralize their classrooms by virtual attendance. The importance of attendance management apps could not be better pronounced than it is currently, the world over. Schools could efficiently track teaching time using smartphones, the internet, swiping technology, biometric terminals, and desktop readers.
            
            
            Configuration
            Schools can choose attendance management systems that suit their needs considering their work nature and policies in place. Electronic attendance apps can be integrated with any third-party attendance hardware like swipe biometric, as explained above, capturing GPS-based attendance with mobile configurations.
            
            
            Recording of Absenteeism Related Data
            Efficient attendance management apps come in handy when making evidence-based decisions arising from students’ and teachers’ absenteeism. Teachers can record the reasons for absence by students in schools. Management can monitor the reasons for late reporting by teachers. They can, too, monitor the reasons for absence by teachers in escalated scenarios. Conventional paperwork attendance monitoring required students to fill lengthy forms. These forms were cumbersome, consuming necessary spaces in offices as well as consuming time.
            
            
            Lean Data Entry
            In these integrated attendance management systems, there is room for just in time data entry. This saves cloud-space as only relevant school, teacher, and student attendance data can be entered or accessed at a specific time. Again, only the required data is printed. In previous attendance monitoring models, teachers and students were exposed to colossal data handling mechanisms even when they just needed an iota of information. They had to peruse loads of documents to enter and access data.
            
            
            Security
            Most automated online attendance apps have linked-up home and office security solutions like RFID and biometric based systems that ensure total protection for essential user data. They prevent infringement, imposition, and control permissions for and by users. Teachers can easily undertake auto-calculation of leave and reward points accrued. They present students and teachers with increased security and confidentiality, utilizing role-based permissions to users.
            
            
            Compliance
            Inaccurately kept records can cost schools a lot of money, especially in overtime payment, and violate labour governing laws, resulting in expensive litigation. Schools are centrally controlled by specific policies implemented from time to time by regulatory authorities. Quality assurance in education revolves around performance by teachers and students with the frequency both interact. Trade unions may capitalize on wrong attendance information, for instance, to defend their legal course in situations where they may feel teachers, staff and schools are being abused. An attendance system integrating payroll simplifies the process for regulatory authorities to undertake their mandate. With these tremendous benefits, it’s easy for schools to choose the best comprehensive attendance management application that provides a seamless workflow. Most of these apps are one-stop-shop that offers convenience, security, and efficiency while handling a vast attendance data recor</p>
